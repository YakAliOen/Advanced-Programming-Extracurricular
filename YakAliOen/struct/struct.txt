Here are some challenge ideas to help you practice and improve your use of structs in C++:

Multiple Students:
Store and display data for multiple students using an array or vector of student structs.

Search Function:
Allow the user to search for a student by NIS or Name and display their details.

Edit Student Data:
Implement a function to edit a student's information after it has been entered.

Delete Student:
Allow the user to remove a student from the list.

Sort Students:
Sort the students by Name, NIS, or DOB and display the sorted list.

File I/O:
Save all student data to a file and load it back when the program starts.

Statistics:
Count and display the number of male and female students.

Validation:
Add input validation (e.g., check that NIS/NISN are numbers, DOB is in correct format).
